An ISP is granted the block 80.70.56.0/21. The ISP needs to allocate addresses for two organizations each with 500 addresses, two organizations each with 250 addresses, and three organizations each with 50 addresses.
a) Find the number and range of addresses in the ISP block.
CIDR: /21 means 32 - 21 = 11 host bits.

Total addresses: 2(11)=2048 IP addresses.

Address Range:
Starting IP: 80.70.56.0

Total IPs: 2048

Ending IP:
Add 2048 - 1 = 2047 to the starting IP.

Let's break it down:
80.70.56.0 to 80.70.63.255

✅ So the address range is:
80.70.56.0 – 80.70.63.255

b) Find the range of addresses for each organization and the range of unallocated addresses.
Address Allocations:
Organization	Range	Subnet
Org A	80.70.56.0 – 80.70.57.255	/23
Org B	80.70.58.0 – 80.70.59.255	/23
Org C	80.70.60.0 – 80.70.60.255	/24
Org D	80.70.61.0 – 80.70.61.255	/24
Org E	80.70.62.0 – 80.70.62.63	/26
Org F	80.70.62.64 – 80.70.62.127	/26
Org G	80.70.62.128 – 80.70.62.191	/26

🟩 Unallocated IP Range:
80.70.62.192 – 80.70.63.255

Total: 320 IPs

version 2
no auto-summary
network 192.175.10.0
network 192.175.11.0
exit

4. What are the Gateway IP Addresses used in the Router?
| Network         | Router Interface   | Gateway IP       |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 192.175.10.0/24 | GigabitEthernet0/0 | **192.175.10.1** |

1. Configure the Router Using Config and CLI Tabs
Using Config Tab:
Click Router0 → Go to Config.

Select GigabitEthernet0/0:

Port Status: ON

IP Address: 192.168.1.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Select GigabitEthernet0/1:

Port Status: ON

IP Address: 192.168.2.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Method2) Using CLI Tab:
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit

Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit

Router(config)# exit
Router# write memory

2. What are the Gateway IP Addresses?
| Network                  | Gateway IP                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Left Network (PC0, PC1)  | `192.168.1.1` (Router0 Gi0/0) |
| Right Network (PC2, PC3) | `192.168.2.1` (Router0 Gi0/1) |

3. What Are the Two Main Protocols Used in Email Services?
SMTP-Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
POP3-Post Office Protocol v3

4. Why Are Switches and Routers Used in This Setup?
Switches are used to:
Connect multiple devices (PCs, servers) within the same local network (LAN).
Enable fast internal communication between devices.

Routers are used to:
Connect different networks (e.g., 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0).
Route data between the two LANs.
Allow communication between PC0/PC1 and PC2/PC3.

 5. Screenshot of Successful Email Configuration
Connect the Server to the Switch:
Click the Connections (lightning bolt ⚡) tool.
Select Copper Straight-Through.
Click Server’s FastEthernet0, then click Switch0’s an empty port (e.g., Fa0/3).

Click on the Server.
Go to Config tab > Select FastEthernet0.
Fill in:
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (Router0 Gi0/0)

in the same Server window, go to the Services tab.
Click Email on the left.
Make sure both services are ON:
SMTP: ON ✅
POP3: ON ✅

Add two users:
user1@domain.com → password: 123
user2@domain.com → password: 456

Configure PC0 to send email.
Configure PC1 (or any other PC) to receive email.
Then you can take a screenshot of the success message.
